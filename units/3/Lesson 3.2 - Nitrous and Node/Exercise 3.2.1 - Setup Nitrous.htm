            <p>
                After clicking on the link in the email, you should be taken to a screen
                that lets you create a "Box".
            </p>
            <p class="sidenote">
                Nitrous calls a web server a "Box".

            <div class="instruction">
                <p>
                    Select <img style="margin:0px;" src="signup7.png" height="14pt;"> as the type of box (see picture below).  <span class="red">Make sure you do this!</span>.

                Leave the Name and Region as they are.  The name is the name of the server in
                nitrous and will not show up in the URL for your application.  We will give you a chance to pick a URL for your web application (including a DNS host name) later in the project.

                Nitrous runs on "N2O", which are units of processing that you consume 
                by using Nitrous.  If you run out, talk to your teachers (and we will add some).
                If you get emails from Nitrous about "almost running out of N20", you can ignore them.
            </p>

            <p class="sidenote">
                Nitrous has a web application (which you can see by pressing "Take my to my Box"), but we will use the Chrome Application instead.  The Chrome Application is very similar
                but it has some nice features like copy and paste.
            </p>

            <h3>Install the Nitrous Chrome App</h3>
            <div class="instruction">
                <p>
                    Click the Store icon in Chrome.

            <div class="instruction">
                <p>
                    You will see <span class="red">two versions</span> of the nitrous application.  You want version <b>1.0.2</b>.
                    Click on the first one and select the details tab.
                </p>

            <div class="instruction">

                <p>
                    You might need to go back and look at the second one to find the right version (<b>1.0.2</b>).
                </p>
                <p>
                    Once you have found the right version, install it correct version of the app  by clicking the <img style="margin:0px;height:13pt;" src="chrome5.png"> button.
                </p>
