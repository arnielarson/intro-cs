            <h1>Exercise 1.3.5</h1>
            <h2>Your own objects</h2>
            <p>
                In the Exercises in this lesson, we used objects for the number
                of students in a school, and for points on a line.  But the
                sky is the limit!  You can use objects for any data <b>that is
                related</b>.
            </p>
            <p>
                For this assignment, think of an object in the real world
                that you would like to be able to store information about
                in a computer.  <b>It can be anything</b>.  Think about what
                properties you want to store (which might not be all
                the properties of the real world object).
            </p>
            <p>
                For example, if you wanted to store a cat object, you would
                have to figure out what <b>parts</b> of a cat you cared about.
                Fur color?  Eye color?  Name?  Age?
            </p>
            <p>
                Then, think about what <b>functions</b> you would have for that
                object.  Those function might be like the real world <b>actions</b>
                that might apply for that object.  What can happen to your object
                that would change the properties?                
            </p>
            <p>
                Finally, try to write down some examples of these objects,
                and use them with functions you write.
            </p>
            <h3>What about text?</h3>
            <p>
                So far, we have been working with number values (and object values).
                Many real world objects have properties that are not numbers.  If you want your
                object to have properties that are <b>text</b>, you can place
                the text between double quotes to write what Javascript calls a
                <b>string value</b>:<br>
            </p>
            <div class="code">
                "<span class="placeholder">text</span>"
            </div>
            <p>
            For example:                
            </p>
            <div class="code">
                var pawsTheCat = {<br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;age: 6,<br>                
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;name: <span class="highlight">"paws"</span>,<br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;eyeColor: <span class="highlight">"brown"</span>,<br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;furColor: <span class="highlight">"gray"</span><br>
                };<br>
            </div>
            <p>
                We are going to learn more about string values and text in the next lesson.
                (If you get stuck, you can find more information
                <a href="../../../resources/jssubset.htm#String">here</a>).
            </p>
            <h3>Object as property value?</h3>
            <p>
                A value of a property of an object can be another object.  For example,
                if the cat <b>paws</b> considers the neighbor dog <b>bruno</b> to
                be an enemy,
                then we can write something like:
            </p>
            <div class="code">
                var brunoTheDog = {<br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;age: 3<br>
                };<br>
                <br>
                var pawsTheCat = {<br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;age: 6<br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;enemy: <span class="highlight">brunoTheDog</span><br>
                };<br>
            </div>
            <p>
                If we drew the above as a diagram, we would have:
            </p>
            <img src="diagram13.png">
            <p>
                If we wanted to see the <b>age</b> of the <b>enemy</b> of paws (<span class="code">3</span>), we could write:
            </p>
            <div class="code">
                var pawsEnemy = pawsTheCat.enemy;<br>
                var pawsEnemyAge = pawsEnemy.age;
            </div>            
            <p>
                Or just:
            </p>
            <div class="code">
                var pawsEnemyAge = pawsTheCat.enemy.age;
            </div>
            <h2>Done!</h2>
