            <h1>Exercise 1.5.3</h1>
            <h2>Class size change</h2>
            <p>
                The UPrep staff has an additional question
                that they would like you to answer.  They are
                interested in how much each class has <b>changed in size</b>
                from last year to this year.
            </p>
            <p>
                For example, if the <b>11th</b> grade had <b>80</b> students last year,
                and the <b>12th</b> grade has <b>76</b> students this year, then the
                class decreased by <b>4</b> students (since 11th graders
                last year are 12th graders this year).
            </p>
            <p>
                They would like you to calculate for <b>7th</b> grade through <b>12th</b> grade
                whether the class has 
                <b>increased</b> or <b>decreased</b> by more than
                <b>4</b> students.
            </p>
            <h3>Calculating the change</h3>
            <p>
                We should be able to calculate the <b>change</b> for each grade by
                subtracting the value for <b>this year</b> from the corresponding
                value from <b>last year</b>.
            </p>
            <p>
                That means an increase is a <b>positive</b> number, and a decrease
                is a <b>negative</b> number.
            </p>
            <h3>Checking the change</h3>
            <p>
                So if we know the <b>change</b> value, we can
                calculate whether the value has decreased or increased by more than 4
                by writing:
                
            </p>
            <div class="code">
                var increasedByMoreThan4 = change &gt; 4;<br>
                var decreasedByMoreThan4 = change &lt; -4;
            </div>
            <p>
                This will give us two values that are either true or false.
                We want a way to calculate whether <b>either</b>
                value is true.   
            </p>
            <h3>Logical OR</h3>
            <p>
                Javascript has way of calculating whether <b>either</b>
                of two boolean
                values are true, called a <b>logical OR</b> expression.
                A logical OR expression is written:
            </p>
            <div class="code">
                <span class="placeholder">firstExpression</span> || <span class="placeholder">secondExpression</span>
            </div>
            <p>
                The result of calculating a logical OR expression is
                <b>true</b> if <b>either</b> <b>firstExpression</b> or
                <b>secondExpression</b> are true, and <b>false</b> otherwise.
            </p>
            <p>
                What values would you expect if we calculated the following logical OR
                expressions?
            </p>
            <div class="answerFrame">
                <div class="answerButton">
                    Move your mouse to the value column to see the answers.
                </div>
                <table class="simple">
                    <tr>
                        <th>Logical OR expression</th>
                        <th>value</th>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td><span class="code">true || true</span></td>
                        <td><div class="answerCell"><span class="code">true</span></div></td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td><span class="code">true || false</span></td>
                        <td><div class="answerCell"><span class="code">true</span></div></td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td><span class="code">false || true</span></td>
                        <td><div class="answerCell"><span class="code">true</span></div></td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td><span class="code">false || false</span></td>
                        <td><div class="answerCell"><span class="code">false</span></div></td>
                    </tr>
                </table>
            </div>
            <p>
            <p>
                Just like a logical AND expression, a logical OR expression can be used
                more than once in an expression.  For example, to see if <b>three</b>
                expressions are all true, we would write:
            </p>
            <div class="code">
                <span class="placeholder">firstExpression</span> || <span class="placeholder">secondExpression</span> || <span class="placeholder">thirdExpression</span><br>
            </div>
            <p>
                Just like a logical AND expression, Javascript may not need to calculate
                all the expressions in a logical OR expression.  As soon as one of the
                calculated expressions produces true, the
                overall expression is true, and Javascript can stop.
            </p>
            <p>
                For example, if calculating <b>firstExpression</b> produces <b>false</b>, it
                will continue to <b>secondExpression</b>.  If 
                calculating <b>secondExpression</b> produces <b>true</b>, then
                it will stop (since there is no point in calculating <b>thirdExpression</b>).
            </p>
            <p class="sidenote">
                Once again, you probably use this technique all the time without even thinking
                about it.  Imagine
                you wanted to know if <b>anyone</b> in your class ate breakfast this morning.
                You could ask the first person, and they might say no.  Then you could
                ask another person, and they might say yes.  Would you continue asking more
                people?  Probably
                not, since you know there is at least one person that ate breakfast
                (meaning <b>someone</b> ate breakfast).  This is another example of 
                <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Short-circuit_evaluation">Short Circuit Evaluation</a>.
            </p>
            <h3>Using a logical OR expression</h3>
            <p>
                We can now use a logical OR expression to calculate
                whether a change is greater than 4.
            </p>
            <div class="code">
                var increasedByMoreThan4 = change &gt; 4;<br>
                var decreasedByMoreThan4 = change &lt; -4;<br>
                var changedByMoreThan4 = increasedByMoreThan4 || decreasedByMoreThan4;                
            </div>
            <p>
                Combining some of the expressions, we have:
            </p>
            <div class="code">
                var changedByMoreThan4 = change &gt; 4 || change &lt; -4;                
            </div>
            <h3>Inputs</h3>
            <p>
            <p>
                You can find the input data for <b>this year</b> here:
            </p>
            <div class="code">
                var thisYear = {<br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;grade7: 74,<br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;grade8: 74,<br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;grade9: 82,<br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;grade10: 81,<br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;grade11: 79,<br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;grade12: 76<br>
                };<br>
            </div>
            <p class="sidenote">
                Where is <b>grade6</b>?  We can't calculate
                the change for this grade because these
                students were not at the school last year.
            </p>
            <p>
                You can find the input data for <b>last year</b> here:
            </p>
            <div class="code">
                var lastYear = {<br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;grade6: 65,<br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;grade7: 70,<br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;grade8: 72,<br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;grade9: 80,<br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;grade10: 80,<br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;grade11: 80<br>
                };<br>
            </div>
            <p class="sidenote">
                Where is <b>grade12</b>?  They graduated!
            </p>
            <h3>The output</h3>
            <p>
                The output for this exercise should be an
                object value with a property
                for <b>grade7</b> through <b>grade12</b>.
            </p>
            <p>
                Each property should have a boolean value
                that is <b>true</b> if the change
                was greater than 4, and <b>false</b> otherwise.
            </p>
            <h2>Ready to start</h2>
            <p>
                At this point, you should have all the information
                necessary to calculate the output described above.
                You will need a <b>plan</b>, of course.
            </p>
            <p>
                Once you have a plan, then go ahead and
                create a folder for this exercise (<b>Exercise 1.5.3</b>) containing
                <b>default.html</b> and <b>uprep.cs</b>.
            </p>
            <p>
                Make sure you create appropriate test cases
                (using <a href="Exercise%201.5.1.htm#Assert">assert</a>) to test
                your algorithm.
