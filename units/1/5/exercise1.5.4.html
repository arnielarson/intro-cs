            <h1>Exercise 1.5.4- A harder problem with Arrays</h1>

            <h2>Calculating Prime Numbers</h2>
            <p>
                Prime Numbers are numbers that are only divisible by 1 and themselves.
            </p>
            <p>
                Here are some examples:
            </p>
            <div class="code">
                2</br>
                3</br>
                5</br>
                7</br>
            </div>
            <p>
                7 is a prime number because it is only evenly divisible by 1 and 7.
            </p>
            <p> 
                In this assignment you will create a program that generates prime numbers!
            </p>
            <p>
                To do this, you will need to think of a way to write a computer program 
                to check if a number is prime.
            </p>
            <p>
                You will need to create an algorithm.  You might want to read about the
                <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sieve_of_Eratosthenes">Sieve of 
                Eratosthenes</a> - an algorithm that could be used.
            </p>
            <h2>The Assignment</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><p>Create a program that can calculate prime numbers</p></li>
                <li><p>Use your knowledge of for loops and arrays to help you 
                generate prime numbers</p></li>
                <li><p>For each prime number you find, you should probably keep track of it in 
                an array</p></li>
                <li><p>Tell your instructor what the 100th prime number is</p></li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Done!</h2>
            <p>
                When you've finished this example, show your instructor how your program works.
            </p>
