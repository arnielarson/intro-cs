            <h1>Exercise 1.5.2- More practice with Arrays</h1>
            <p>
                Here are a couple more challenges to help you understand how to use arrays.
            <p>
            <p>
                In the first part of this exercise, you should investigate some of 
                the methods that arrays have!  You've already seen at least one property
                that arrays have, the length property
            <p>
            <div class="code">
                var myarray = [ 1, 3, 7, 11 ];</br>
                var length = myarray.length; </br>

            </div>
            <p>
                Since arrays are also Javascript objects, they have other methods associated with
                them.  A few of those methods are show below.

            <h2>Part 1 - Array Methods</h2>
            <p>
                Now that you understand how to use arrays are another useful datastructure 
                for computer programming lets get some more practice with them.  
            </p>
            <p> 
                In this exercise you will use an array to calucate the
                sum, just like in the previous example.
            </p>
            <p> 
                For example, if your array had the values 6, 2 and 3
            </p>
            <div class="code">
            var numbers = [ 6, 2, 3 ];</br>
            </div>
            <p> 
                Then the results of your caluclation would be 11.
            </p>
            <p> 
                Just like in the example, when you calculate your sum, you should
                use a for loop when you "look" at each element in the array.
            </p>
            <h2>The Assignment, Part 1</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><p>Create an html page and a Javascritp file for this exercise</p></li>
                <li>
                    <p>In the Javascript file create an array with some numbers and create a
                function </p>
                    <p>It might look like this:</p>
                    <div class="code">
                        var numbers = [ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5];</br></br>
                        function calculateSum() {</br>
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;// do the sum here</br>
                        }
                    </div>
                
                </li>
                <li><p>Your function should sum all the numbers in the array</p></li>
                <li><p>Change the values in the array and make sure your program works</p></li>
            </ul>
            <div class="instruction">

                    <b>A Little Extra Help!</b> 
                </p>
                <p>
                    To help you get started, download the following 
                    <a href="starter/sum.zip">zip</a> which contains useful starting code.
                </p>
            </div>
            <h2>Done!</h2>
            <p>
                When you've finished Part 1 show your program to your instructor!
            </p>
            </br></br>

            <h2>Part 2 - Calculating Factorials</h2>
            <p>
                Factorials are created by multiplying numbers together that are equal to or 
                less than the number.
            </p>
            <p>
                We use the ! sign to indicate that a number is a factorial. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Here are some examples:
            </p>
            <div class="code">
                1! = 1</br>
                2! = 2 * 1 = 2</br>
                3! = 3 * 2 * 1 = 6</br>
                4! = 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 12</br>
            </div>
            <p>
                You can say that "4 factorial" is equal to 12.
            </p>
            <p>
                How do you think a computer could be useful to calculate factorials?
            </p>
            <p> 
                In this assignment, you need to think of a way to write a computer program 
                to do this calculation for you?
            </p>
            <p> 
                Hint - you should use a for loop.
            </p>
            <h2>The Assignment, Part 2</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><p>Create a program that calculates factorials</p></li>
                <li><p>Your program should have a function which does the calculation</p></li>

                        function calculateFactorial( n ) {</br>
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;var factorial;</br>
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;// calculate the factorial here</br>
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;return factorial;</br>
                        }
