            <h1>Exercise 1.5.2 - More Practice with Arrays and For Loops</h1>
            <h2>Calculating Factorials</h2>
            <p>
                Factorials are created by multiplying numbers together that are equal to or 
                less than the number.
            </p>
            <p>
                We use the ! sign to indicate that a number is a factorial. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Here are some examples:
            </p>
            <div class="code">
                1! = 1</br>
                2! = 2 * 1 = 2</br>
                3! = 3 * 2 * 1 = 6</br>
                4! = 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 24</br>
            </div>
            <p>
                You can say that "4 factorial" is equal to 24.
            </p>
            <p> 
                In this assignment, you need to think of a way to write a computer program 
                to do this calculation for you.
            </p>
            <h2>The Assignment</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><p>Create a program that calculates factorials</p></li>
                <li><p>Your program should have a function which does the calculation</p></li>
                    <div class="code">
                        function calculateFactorial( n ) {</br>
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;var factorial;</br>
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;// calculate the factorial here</br>
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;return factorial;</br>
                        }
                    </div>
                <li><p>To check your work - you can go to
                    <a href="http://www.google.com">google</a>, type in 4!, 
                    and see an answer!
                </li>
                <li><p>What answer does your program give for 5! and 10!?  What about 1000!? </p></li>
            </ul>
