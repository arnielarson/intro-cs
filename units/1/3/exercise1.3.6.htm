            <h2>Character Codes</h2>
            <h3>Copyright</h3>
            <p>
                Have you ever come across some characters on a web page
                that are not on your keyboard?  For example,
                the copyright symbol at the bottom of
                <a href="https://www.facebook.com/">https://www.facebook.com/</a>?
            </p>
            <img src="chrome12.png">
            <p>
                These characters are not on your keyboard, but they are
                still characters, and we can still use them in our HTML
                and our Javascript.  We just need to know their <b>character code</b>.
            </p>
            <h3>Character Codes</h3>
            <p>
                Every character that you can use in a computer has a character code (a <b>number</b>).
                This means that text in a computer is really just a series of numbers
                in a row, but the computer knows that these series of numbers meant
                to be used as characters and not numbers.
            </p>
            <p>
                To see this in action, go to the following web site and type
                some text.
            </p>
            <p>
                <a href="http://ascii.co.uk/interactive">http://ascii.co.uk/interactive</a>
            </p>
            <p>
                For example:
            </p>
            <img src="chrome13.png">
            <p>
                You should see a series of boxes appear that have the number
                (the character code) of each of the characters you typed.
            </p>
            <p class="sidenote">
                The character code is also shown in base 16 (<b>Hex</b>,
                short for hexadecimal)
                and base 8 (<b>Oct</b>, short for octal).  Programmers
                sometimes like to use different number bases.
            </p>
            <h3>Who decides?</h3>
            <p>
                But who picks the character code for a character?  Who decides that
                an <span class="key">U</span> is an <b>85</b>, a <span class="key">P</span>
                is an <b>80</b>, and so on?  
            </p>
            <p>
                Whatever numbers we pick, we better all agree, otherwise when
                one computer reads the web page that was made by another computer,
                it might get confused.
            </p>
            <h3>We need a table</h3>
            <p>
                So we really need a <b>table</b> that shows us what character codes
                go with what characters.
            </p>
            <p>
                One of the first such tables (finalized in 1963) had only <b>128</b> different
                characters.
                It was called
                <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII">ASCII</a>,
                which is short for
                American Standard Code for Information Interchange.
            </p>
            <p>
                You can see part of the table here:                
                <a href="http://ascii.co.uk/table">http://ascii.co.uk/table</a>
            </p>
            <h3>We need a bigger table</h3>
            <p>
                When you looked at the ASCII table, you may have noticed that
                the letters are mostly english.  What about the rest of the
                languages in the world?
            </p>
            <p>
                In 1991, the first version of a standard called 
                <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicode">Unicode</a>
                was finalized.  This version of Unicode allowed for up
                to <b>65535</b> characters.
                This larger range of character codes (larger table) allowed
                for characters used in many more written languages.  Since
                1991, even more characters have been added.
            </p>
            <p>
                Take a look: 
                <a href="http://www.unicode.org/charts/">http://www.unicode.org/charts/</a>.
                You will find <b>Scripts</b>(writing systems) at the top,
                and <b>Symbols and Punctuation</b> at the bottom.                
            </p>
            <p class="sidenote">
                You might want to bookmark this page, if you want to use
                any of the unicode special characters in this class.
            </p>
            <p>
                As you can see, there is quite a variety!  Here are some examples:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><a href="http://www.unicode.org/charts/PDF/U0600.pdf">Arabic</a></li>
                <li><a href="http://www.unicode.org/charts/PDF/U1800.pdf">Mongolian</a></li>
                <li><a href="http://www.unicode.org/charts/PDF/U13000.pdf">Egyptian Hieroglyphs</a></li>
                <li><a href="http://www.unicode.org/charts/PDF/U13A0.pdf">Cherokee</a></li>
                <li><a href="http://www.unicode.org/charts/PDF/U2600.pdf">Miscellaneous Symbols</a> (snowman!)</li>
                <li><a href="http://www.unicode.org/charts/PDF/U2800.pdf">Braille Patterns</a></li>
                <li><a href="http://www.unicode.org/charts/PDF/U2190.pdf">Arrows</a></li>
                <li><a href="http://www.unicode.org/charts/PDF/U1F600.pdf">Emoticons</a></li>
                <li>and of course, <a href="http://www.unicode.org/charts/PDF/U0000.pdf">ASCII</a></li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                And if you look under
                <a href="http://www.unicode.org/charts/PDF/U0080.pdf">
                    Punctuation / General Punctuation / Latin-1 Punctuation</a>,
                you will find the copyright symbol:
            </p>
            <img src="chrome14.png">
            <p>
                The number below the character (<b>00A9</b>)
                is the character code shown in hexadecimal (base 16, or <b>hex</b> for short).
            </p>
            <h3 id="Copyright">So how do we use these characters?</h3>
            <p>
                If we have the character code in <b>hex</b>, we can write these
                characters in both Javascript and HTML.
            </p>
            <p>
                For example, to write the copyright symbol (<b>00A9</b> in hex) followed
                by the year in <b>HTML</b>, we would write:
            </p>
            <div class="sidebyside">
                <div class="side">
                    <div class="code">
                        &lt;p&gt;<span class="highlight">&amp;#x00A9;</span> 2013&lt;/p&gt;
                    </div>
                </div>
                <div class="side">
                    <p style="font-size:24pt;"><span class="highlight">&#x00A9;</span> 2013</p>
                </div>
            </div>
            <p>
                To write the same thing in <b>Javascript</b>, we would write:
            </p>
            <div class="code">
                var copyright = "<span class="highlight">\u00A9</span> 2013";
            </div>
            <p class="sidenote">
                You might notice that some of the character codes have 5 hex digits,
                which means we can't use them with Javascript.
            </p>
            <h3>But there's a catch...</h3>
            <p>
                The UNICODE standard has a lot of different characters.
            </p>
            <p>
                But remember, there are different <b>fonts</b>, too.  For example, the
                character <span class="key">A</span> looks different with different
                fonts.
            </p>
            <p>
                <span style="font-size:48pt;font-family:Palatino;">A</span> 
                <span style="font-size:48pt;font-family:Garamond;">A</span> 
                <span style="font-size:48pt;font-family:Bookman;">A</span>
                <span style="font-size:48pt;font-family:'Avant Garde';">A</span>
                <span style="font-size:48pt;font-family:Verdana;">A</span>
                <span style="font-size:48pt;font-family:Georgia;">A</span>
                <span style="font-size:48pt;font-family:'Comic Sans MS';">A</span>
                <span style="font-size:48pt;font-family:'Trebuchet MS';">A</span>
                <span style="font-size:48pt;font-family:'Arial Black';">A</span>
                <span style="font-size:48pt;font-family:Impact;">A</span>
                <span style="font-size:48pt;font-family:Courier;">A</span>
            </p>
            <p>
                So a font is really a <b>table</b> as well.  The table
                says what <b>picture</b> to use for each character in that font.
            </p>
            <p>
                And it turns out that not every font has a picture for every character.
                For example, if you use one of the
                <a href="http://www.unicode.org/charts/PDF/U2800.pdf">Braille Patterns</a>
                they may or may not work depending on what font you use.
            </p>
            <p>
                If you see a character like this:                
            </p>
            <p>
                <img src="chrome32.png">
            </p>
            <p>
                It usually means that there is no picture for that character code
                in that font.
            </p>
            <p class="sidenote">
                So, how do you know what font works for what characters?
                If you search for the words <b>font</b>, <b>unicode</b>,
                and the hex characters of the character, you may find a list
                of fonts.  Of course, you may not have that font on your computer.
            </p>

            <p class="sidenote">
                Of course, if we were doing this for a real web site, we would need
                to take additional <a href="http://www.copyright.gov/circs/circ66.pdf">steps</a>.
