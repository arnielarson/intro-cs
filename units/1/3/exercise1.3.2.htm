            <h1>Exercise 1.3.2</h1>
            <h2>Number of UPrep Students</h2>
            <h3>Even better than a blank page!</h3>
            <p>
                In this class, we have had a number of exercises where you have been knee-deep
                in the Javascript and not even a <b>single thing</b>
                showed up on the screen.  
                Things are about
                to change...  <span class="woot"></span>
            </p>
            <p>
                In this series of exercises, we are now going to use a web page
                for the <b>output</b> of an algorithm.
                Remember this?<br>
                <img src="diagram5.png"><br>
                The <b>output</b> of an algorithm doesn't just have to sit in a variable
                once we have calculated it.
                We can send it to the screen, send it to a 3d printer, send it
                to another computer, ... 
            </p>
            <h3>The assignment</h3>
            <p id="Match">
                We are going to make the following page for the UPrep staff.  It shows
                the <b>number of students</b> in each grade.<br>
                <img src="chrome2.png">
            </p>
            <h3>The plan</h3>
            <p>
                The above picture is the final product.  We need to take things
                step by step.
                The overall plan is as follows:
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>Create an HTML page that just uses fake student numbers.</li>
                <li>Style the page using CSS.</li>
                <li>Add Javascript that fills in the actual student numbers.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>
                We will do steps <b>1</b> and <b>2</b> in this Exercise, and
                step <b>3</b> in the following exercises.
            </p>
            <p class="sidenote">
                It is common to have a plan like this when creating web sites.  First, you might
                make a website that looks nice, but uses fake data and does not actually work
                (often called called a
                <b>design mockup</b>).  When you are happy with the design of the site,
                and you know what the site is supposed to do,
                then you actually write the Javascript and make the site work correctly.
                The job of creating the design mockup may done by someone
                that knows CSS and HTML
                (and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphic_design">Graphic Design</a>),
                but may not know Javascript.
            </p>
            <h3>First, the HTML</h3>
            <p class="sidenote">
                If you are stuck on this part, you might want to review
                <a href="../Lesson%201.1%20-%20Web%20page%20basics/Exercise%201.1.1.htm">Exercise 1.1.1</a>.
            </p>            
            <p>
                Remember when we said that HTML was for was <b>what</b> we wanted displayed
                on a page, and CSS was for <b>how</b> we want it to look?
                We need to start with the HTML.
            </p>
            <p>
                Lets first identify what kind of elements we will be using:
            </p>
            <img src="diagram3.png">
            <p>
                Now that we know what kind of elements to use, lets try to create
                the HTML for this page.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        Create a folder for this exercise (<b>Exercise 1.4.2</b>).   
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    
            <p>
                You can find the image to use for the UPrep logo here (Save Image As... to your folder):<br>
                <img src="logo-uprep.png">
            </p>
                </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    Create a <b>default.html</b> file in your folder.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
            <p>
                Add the different elements inside the HTML body element.
                If you need help on writing the HTML, you can use the following reference:
                <ul>
                    <li><a href="../../../resources/htmlsubset.htm#Paragraph">Paragraph Element</a></li>
                    <li><a href="../../../resources/htmlsubset.htm#Header">Header Element</a> (using an <b>h1</b> element is fine)</li>
                    <li><a href="../../../resources/htmlsubset.htm#Image">Image Element</a></li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            </li>
            <li>
            <p>
                We can just use fake student numbers for now, like <b>6</b> for sixth
                grade, <b>7</b> for seventh grade, etc.
            </p>
            </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                When you load your page in Chrome, it should look something like the following.                
            </p>
            <img src="chrome3.png">
            <h3>Next, the CSS</h3>
            <p class="sidenote">
                If you get stuck on this part, you might want to refer
                back to <a href="Exercise%201.4.1.htm">Exercise 1.4.1.htm</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
                Ok, lets make the page look nicer by adding some CSS!
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>Create a CSS file <b>uprep.css</b> in your folder.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Link the CSS file to your HTML file using
                    the <a href="../../../resources/htmlsubset.htm#Link">Link Element</a>.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        Add CSS styles to your CSS file.   You can name
                        them whatever you want (but don't use spaces in the names).
                Here is a guide to what properties your styles will need:
                        <img src="diagram4.png">                        
                    </p>
                </li>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Add a
                    <a href="../../../resources/htmlsubset.htm#Class">Class Attribute</a>
                    to each element you want styled.</p>
                </li>                
                <li>                    
                    <p>Here is some additional information you will need:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <p>
                            The blue color is <span class="code">#005784</span>.
                                
                            </p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>
                            The font is <span class="code">Arial, sans-serif</span>.
                                
                            </p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>
                            The font sizes are <span class="code">16pt</span> and
                            <span class="code">20pt</span>.                            
                            </p>
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                    Does it have to <a href="#Match">match</a> perfectly?  No, but your styles
                    should have the properties shown above.
                </li>
            </ul>
            
            <h2>Done!</h2>
            <p>
                Head back to Schoology and submit your work (the CSS and HTML).
            </p>
