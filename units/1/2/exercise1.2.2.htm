            <h1>Exercise 1.2.2</h1>
            <h2>More UPrep planning</h2>
            <p>
                We will continue with our hypothetical
                problem that the UPrep staff gave us in <a href="exercise1.2.1.htm">Exercise 1.2.1</a>.
                But the problem is evolving.
            </p>
            <p>
                The UPrep staff love the fact that you were able to write a program
                to calculate the average number of students per grade for the
                the 2014/2015 school year.  However, they would like you to 
                <b>also</b> make these calculations for <b>last year</b> as well so they
                can compare the numbers from the two years to make sure their plan makes sense.
            </p>
            <h2>First, lets make a plan</h2>
            <p>
                Just like last time, we we'll create a plan for our problem
                by answering the following questions:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>What is the input data?</li>
                <li>What is the output data?</li>
                <li>What are the steps in the algorithm?</li>
                <li>What temporary data does the algorithm need?</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>What is the input data?</h3>
            <p>
                The UPrep staff have given us our input data for both <b>this year</b>
                year and <b>last year</b>:
            </p>
            <table class="simple">
                <tr>
                    <th>Grade</th>
                    <th>Number of Students<br> This Year</th>
                    <th>Number of Students<br> Last Year</th>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>6th grade</td>
                    <td>66</td>
                    <td>65</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>7th grade</td>
                    <td>74</td>
                    <td>70</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>8th grade</td>
                    <td>74</td>
                    <td>72</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>9th grade</td>
                    <td>82</td>
                    <td>80</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>10th grade</td>
                    <td>81</td>
                    <td>80</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>11th grade</td>
                    <td>79</td>
                    <td>80</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>12th grade</td>
                    <td>76</td>
                    <td>67</td>
                </tr>
            </table>
            <h3>What is the output data?</h3>
            <p>
                The output is two numbers:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>The <b>average students per grade</b> for <b>this</b> year</li>
                <li>The <b>average students per grade</b> for <b>last</b> year</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>What are the steps for the algorithm?</h3>
            <p>
                There are now two main steps in our algorithm, and each has two sub-steps:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>For this year:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Calculate the total students for the school by adding together the number of students in each grade.</li>
                        <li>Calculate the average students per grade by dividing the total students by 7 (the number of grades in the school).</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>For last year:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Calculate the total students for the school by adding together the number of students in each grade.</li>
                        <li>Calculate the average students per grade by dividing the total students by 7 (the number of grades in the school).</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Done!</h2>

                <li>You have a javascript program in the same folder</li>
                <li>Your program is successfully being run by Chrome</li>
                <li>You can verify that the outputs of your program are correct</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                Head back to Schoology and mark this as done.
