            <h1>Exercise 1.2.5</h1>
            <h2>How Many Coins?</h2>
            <p>
                If you buy something at a shop, and you give the shopkeeper
                too much money, they will (hopefully) give you some change back.
            </p>
            <p>
                In this exercise, we will create a <b>function</b> that
                calculates <b>how many coins</b> a shopkeeper will give as change.
            </p>
            <p>
                We will assume that the shopkeeper only
                gives change using the following <b>coins</b>:
            </p>
            <table class="simple">
                <tr>
                    <th>Name of<br>Coin</th><th>Cents per<br> Coin</th>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Quarter</td><td>25</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Dime</td><td>10</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Nickel</td><td>5</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Penny</td><td>1</td>
                </tr>
            </table>
            <p>
                Also, the shopkeeper would rather give you
                a <b>large</b> coin rather than a <b>small</b>
                coin.
            </p>
            <p>
                The <b>input</b> to your function should be the <b>amount of
                change</b> in cents.  The <b>output</b> should be the <b>number
                of coins</b>.
            </p>
            <h3>Example</h3>
            <p>
                For example, if the amount of change is <b>97</b> cents, the shopkeeper will give <b>7</b> coins:
            </p>
            <table class="simple">
                <tr>
                    <th>Name of <br>Coin</th><th>Cents per <br>Coin</th><th>Number of<br>Coins</th><th>Total<br>Cents</th>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Quarter</td><td>25</td><td>3</td><td>75</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Dime</td><td>10</td><td>2</td><td>20</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Nickel</td><td>5</td><td>0</td><td>0</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Penny</td><td>1</td><td>2</td><td>2</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <th>Total</td><th></th><th>7</th><th>97</th>
                </tr>
            </table>
            <h3>What you need to know</h3>
            <p>
                There is more than one solution to this problem.  But you will probably
                need to know how to
                do at least one of the following:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>How to remove the fractional part of a number.</li>
                <li>How to find the remainder of a division.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                The following sections explain these techniques, which
                may also give you some clues as to how to solve the problem.
            </p>
            <h3>Removing the fractional part of a number</h3>
            <p>
                In the number <span class="code">3.1415927</span>,
                the integer part of the number is <span class="code">3</span> and the fractional
                part of the number is <span class="code">.1415927</span>.
            </p>
            <p>
                Javascript has a function that will remove the fractional part of a number
                called <b>Math.floor</b>.  
                For example, after the following statements are executed, the variable <b>numberWithoutFraction</b>
                will have the value <span class="code">3</span>.
            </p>
            <div class="code">
                var numberWithFraction = 3.1415927;<br>
                var numberWithoutFraction = Math.floor(numberWithFraction);
            </div>
            <p class="sidenote">
                As you might guess, there is also a "ceiling" function (<b>Math.ceil</b>)
                You can learn more about these functions 
                <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floor_and_ceiling_functions">
                    here
                </a>.
            </p>
            <h3>Find the remainder of a division</h3>
            <p>
                You may recall from math that if you divide one number
                by another number you may have a remainder
                (the part of the first number that could not be divided
                evenly by the second number).
            </p>
            <p>
                In Javascript, we can <b>divide</b> two numbers using the symbol <span class="code">/</span>.
                For example, after the following statements are executed, the variable <b>numberWithFraction</b>
                will have the value <span class="code">2.5</span>.
            </p>
            <div class="code">
                var firstNumber = 5;<br>
                var secondNumber = 2;<br>
                var numberWithFraction = firstNumber / secondNumber;
            </div>
            <p>
                In a way similar to division, Javascript uses the symbol
                <span class="code">%</span> for <b>remainder</b>.  
                After the below statements are executed, the variable <b>remainder</b>
                will have the value <span class="code">1</span>.
            </p>
            <div class="code">
                var firstNumber = 5;<br>
                var secondNumber = 2;<br>
                var remainder = firstNumber % secondNumber;
            </div>
            <p>
                The value
                <span class="code">5</span> can be divided evenly by
                <span class="code">2</span> twice, but <span class="code">1</span> is left over
                (the remainder).                
            </p>
            <h3>Ready to start</h3>
            <p>
                First create a folder for your work (Exercise 1.2.4).
            </p>
            <p>
                Once you have a plan, you can create the
                function that calculates the number of coins, and make sure it
                gives the right answer (<b>7</b>) for change of <b>97</b>.                
            </p>
            <h2>Done!</h2>
            <p>
                Head back to Schoology and mark this as done.
            </p>
