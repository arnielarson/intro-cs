            <h1>Exercise 1.2.6</h1>
            <h2>Area of a triangle</h2>
            <p>
                Programming is not all about typing in an editor.  Sometimes you have
                to spend time finding a solution to a problem, or looking up
                which function to use.  This exercise will require more
                investigative work.  Use the web as your resource.
            </p>
            <p>
                Create a function that calculates the <b>area of a triangle</b>
                given the <b>three points</b> that make up a triangle.
            </p>
            <p>
                Create another function to test your function with at
                least two different triangles.
            </p>
            <p>
                Remember you used <b>Math.floor</b> in the last exercise?
                You may need to use additional functions from Math
                in this exercise.
            </p>
            <h2>Done!</h2>
            <p>
                Head back to Schoology and mark this as done.
