                The UPrep staff are back again with another request.  
            </p>
            <p>
                They would like you to use the skills we covered in
                <a href="Exercise%201.2.1.htm">Exercise 1.2.1</a> and
                <a href="Exercise%201.2.2.htm">Exercise 1.2.2</a> to
                make some more calculations for them.
            </p>
            <p>
                In addition to the previous calculations, they would like
                you to also calculate:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>The average number of students per grade in the <b>middle school</b></li>
                <li>The average number of students per grade in the <b>upper school</b></li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                They would like the values for both <b>this year</b> and <b>last year</b>.
            </p>
            <h2>Once you have a plan</h2>
            <p>
                Copy the folder you used for <b>Exercise 1.2.2</b> to create a new folder
                for this exercise (Exercise 1.2.3).  
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>If you are having trouble naming variables, functions and parameters, use the following
                <a href="../../../resources/jssubset.htm#Name">conventions</a> as a guide.</li>
                <li>If you are having trouble figuring out how to break a line, use the following

                <li>
                    Use local variables, return values, and function parameters when possible.

            </ul>
