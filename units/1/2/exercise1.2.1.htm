            <h1>Exercise 1.2.1</h1>
            <h2>Overview of Javascript</h2>
            <p>
                First, read through the <a href="overview.htm">overview</a> on using variables and functions and Javascript.  When you are finished begin reading the exercise below.
            </p>
            <h2>UPrep planning exercise</h2>
            <p>
                In this exercise, we are going to create a solution to the following (hypothetical) problem:
            </p>
            <p>
                The UPrep staff are planning the 2014/2015 school year and 
                have some estimates for how many students would be in each
                grade.  They may want to know the <b>average</b>
                number of students per grade for the whole school.
            </p>
            <h2>Averages</h2>
            <p>
                You probably know from math that the average is the
                sum of the numbers divided by the count of the numbers.
                For example, to average the numbers:
            </p>
            <p>
                2, 3, 7
            </p>
            <p>
                We first total the numbers:
            </p>
            <p>
                 2 + 3 + 7 = 12
            </p>
            <p>
                Then we divide the total by 3 (since there are three numbers):
            </p>
            <p>
                12 / 3 = 4
            </p>
            <h2>Lets make a program!</h2>
            <p>
                To solve this problem we will create a <b>program</b>.
                A program is just a set of Data Structures and Algorithms.
            </p>
            <p>
                There are many ways to construct a program.  Today we are going to
                use a programming language called <b>Javascript</b>
                to construct our program.  In our program, we will
                create an algorithm to solve our problem.                
            </p>
            <p>
                Recall that an algorithm is:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Starts with pieces of data (<b>inputs</b>)</li>
                <li>Produces pieces of data (<b>outputs</b>)</li>
                <li>Has a well-defined set of <b>steps</b> for computing the answer</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                You may also recall that algorithms can also use additional data
                structures while they are computing the result.  We will call those
                <b>temporary</b> data structures.
            </p>
            <h2>Lets make a plan</h2>
            <p>
                When a programmer starts working on a solution to a problem, they often
                start out by taking notes about what approach they will take to the
                solution.  They create a <b>plan</b>.
            </p>
            <p>
                We'll alwys make a plan for our problems by answering the following questions:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>What is the input data?</li>
                <li>What is the output data?</li>
                <li>What are the steps in the algorithm?</li>
                <li>What temporary data does the algorithm need?</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>What is the input data?</h3>
            <p>
                The UPrep staff have given us our input data, which is a count of students
                for each grade at UPrep (for the 2013/2014 year).
            </p>
            <table class="simple">
                <tr>
                    <th>Grade</th>
                    <th>Number of Students</th>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>6th grade</td>
                    <td>66</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>7th grade</td>
                    <td>74</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>8th grade</td>
                    <td>74</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>9th grade</td>
                    <td>82</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>10th grade</td>
                    <td>81</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>11th grade</td>
                    <td>79</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>12th grade</td>
                    <td>76</td>
                </tr>
            </table>
            <h3>What is the output data?</h3>
            <p>
                The output is a single number: the <b>average students per grade</b>
                for the school.
            </p>
            <h3>What are the steps for the algorithm?</h3>
            <p>Our algorithm has two steps:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    Calculate the <b>total students</b> for the school
                    by adding together the number of students in each grade.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Calculate the <b>average students per grade</b> by
                    dividing the <b>total students</b> by 7 (the number of grades in the school).
                </li>
            </ol>
            <p class="sidenote">
                When we write down an informal description of an algorithm (like the above), we
                call the description <b>pseudocode</b>.
            </p>
            <h3>What temporary data does the program need?</h3>
            <p>
                The second step of our algorithm needs the <b>total students</b>
                from the first step.  That calculation is not part of the input or output,
                but is necessary for the algorithm, so it is temporary data.
            </p>
            <h2>Turning the plan into a program</h2>
            <p>
                Now that we have a plan, lets create a program using Javascript.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>We will use <b>variables</b> to define our data structures.</li>
                <li>We will use <b>statements</b> to define the steps of our algorithm.</li>
                <li>We will use <b>functions</b> to group our statements.</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="sidenote">
                You might be wondering, how much of what I'm learning in this class
                is specific to the Javascript programming language?  Am
                I going to be able to use any of what I'm learning for other programming
                languages?  Many (but not all) programming languages have the concepts of
                variables, statements, and functions.  There is a good chance that
                what you learn in this class about Javascript will help you learn other languages
                more easily.
