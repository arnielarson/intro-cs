            <h1>Exercise 1.6.9</h1>
            <h2>If you finish</h2>
            
            <p>
                If you finish the other exercises, here are some ideas for additional exploration.
            </p>            
           
            <h3>Growing bubbles</h3>
            
            <p>
                Make each bubble grow a little each frame, and if they reach
                a certain size, then pop them.  
            </p>
            <img src="capture5.gif">
            <div class="instruction">
                <p>
                    Increase the radius of each bubble each frame.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Each frame, check if the radius is too large, and
                    if so, remove the bubble from the array.
                </p>
            </div>
            
            <h3>Limited drift</h3>
            
            <p>
                Allow the bubbles to drift, but only for N frames (say 10).
            </p>
            
            <img src="capture6.gif">
            <div class="instruction">
                <p>
                    Add a property to each bubble to keep track of how many frames a bubble
                    has been around.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Add one to the property each frame.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Only change dx and dy if the bubble has been around for less than
                    say, 10 frames.
                </p>
            </div>
            
            
            <h3>Warp speed</h3>
            
            <p>
                Hit warp speed in a bubble factory.
            </p>
            
            <img src="capture7.gif">
                
            <div class="instruction">
                <p>
                    Start each bubble at a random point in the canvas. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Each frame, calculate dx and dy so that they move the bubble
                    closer to the center.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When the bubble reaches approximately the center, remove it.
                </p>
            </div>

            <h3>Gravity</h3>
            
            <p>
                Add some gravity.
            </p>
            
            <img src="capture8.gif">
                
            <div class="instruction">
                <p>
                    Start each bubble 1/4 of the way down the canvas.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Each frame, add 1 to dy, to simulate gravity.
                </p>
            </div>
            
            <h3>Colors</h3>
            
            <p>
                Change the color based on how long the bubble has been around.
            </p>
            
            <img src="capture9.gif">
                
            <div class="instruction">
                <p>
                    Add a property to each bubble that counts how many frames
                    it has been around.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Add one to the property each frame.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Add an array of color names.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Compute the index of the color to use from the colors array
                    based on the frame count for the bubble.
                    The larger the frame count, the larger the index.
                </p>
            </div>
            
            <h2>Done!</h2>
