            <h1>Exercise 1.1.2</h1>
            <p>
                The following are additional ideas for exploration.
                You don't have to do them in order.  They are all optional.
            </p>
            <p>
                You probably want to create a new folder (Exercise 1.1.2).

            <h2>Create your own web site</h2>
            <p>
                Take the concepts you learned from <a href="Exercise%201.1.1.htm">Exercise 1.1.1</a>
                and build a bigger web site.  It does not need to be related to smileys or math
                in any way!  <span class="woot"></span>
            </p>
            <h2>Try more HTML elements</h2>
            <p>
                Try creating a <a href="../../../resources/htmlsubset.htm#Anchor">Anchor Element</a>
                to create a link that is within a single page.  You will need to make sure there
                are enough elements on the page if you want to see the page scroll when you click
                on a link.
            </p>
            <p>
                Try creating a <a href="../../../resources/htmlsubset.htm#Header">Header Element</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
                Try creating a <a href="../../../resources/htmlsubset.htm#Division">Division Element</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
                Try creating a <a href="../../../resources/htmlsubset.htm#Span">Span Element</a>.
            </p>
            <h2>Use Developer Tools to inspect a web site</h2>
            <p>
                Point Chrome at
                <a href="http://www.universityprep.org/">http://www.universityprep.org/</a>,
                and open Developer Tools.
            </p>
            <p>
                Try to find the resources that the page uses.
            </p>
            <p>
                Once Chrome has loaded the page, you can explore all the attributes
                for an element.  For example, you can select the Image Element for
                Unversity Prep (top left of page), and inspect it's attribute values
                (look under <b>Properties</b>): 
            </p>
            <img src="chrome21.png">
            <p>
                Find the URL of another image on the web.  You can find the URL
                of an image on a page by choosing Command-click (Mac) or Right-click (Windows)
                on the image, and choose "Copy Image URL".
            </p>
            <p>
                Change the value of the Source Attribute
                (abbreviated <b>src</b>) to the URL of the other image.  You can 
                double-click on the attribute to start editing, then paste the URL
                between the quotes.  Press enter when you are done.  What happened
                to the page?
            </p>
            <img src="chrome22.png">
            <p>
                Try changing other attribute values and see what happens to the
                page.
            </p>
