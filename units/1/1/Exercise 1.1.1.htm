            <h1>Exercise 1.1.1</h1>
            <h2>Install Google Chrome</h2>
            <p>
                Later in this class we will be doing a project which requires the Google
                Chrome web browser.  If you want, you can continue using your current browser
                until then, but all content for this class will assume you are using Google Chrome.
            </p>
            <p class="sidenote">
                Web application developers typically have different web browsers installed so they can test their
                applications in each one, since each one is a little different.  So feel free to
                test your creations in all the browsers you have installed to see if you can see
                any differences.  There are various web sites dedicated to these differences, for example,
                <a href="http://www.quirksmode.org/">http://www.quirksmode.org</a>.
            </p>
            <h2>Create a folder for this exercise</h2>
            <p>
                Create a folder for this exercise on your computer in a place you will remember.
            </p>
            <p class="sidenote">
                Each time you do an exercise for this class, you will likely want to create a folder
                (for example, "Exercise 1.1.1") that will contain contains the files for that exercise.
                You can put all these folders
                inside of one folder (for example, "Computer Science").  For example:
            </p>
            <img src="folder.png"><br>
            <p class="sidenote">
                Staying organized will help you in the long run, since you will likely want to borrow
                from a previous exercise when starting a new one.
            </p>
            <h2>Install Komodo Edit</h2>
            <p>
                We will be using a text editor called Komodo Edit in this class to
                edit both HTML, Javascript and other text files.  If you have another text editor
                you would rather use, you can, but the class content will assume you are using
                Komodo Edit.
            </p>
            <p>
                Go to the following web site and download <b>Komodo Edit 8</b>.  
                Choose the right version for your laptop (mac or windows).
            </p>
            <p>
                <a href="http://www.activestate.com/komodo-edit">http://www.activestate.com/komodo-edit</a>
            </p>
            <p class="sidenote">
                If you are planning on using Komodo Edit for other purposes than this class,
                make sure you understand the license agreement available on the web site.
            </p>
            <h2>Create your first page</h2>
            <p>
                Start Komodo Edit.  You should see a window appear.
            </p>
            <p>
                On the menu, choose File / New / New From Template.  A dialog should appear.                
            </p>
            <p>
                In the <b>Web</b> category, choose the <b>HTML5</b> template.
            </p>
            <p>
                You should see something like this: 
            </p>
            <img src="komodo1.png">
            <p>
                Within the <b>body</b> element, add a paragraph that says Hello.  We want the paragraph
                to be contained within the body element, so it should appear between the <b>start tag</b>
                and <b>end tag</b> of the body (between &lt;body&gt; and &lt;/body&gt;).  If you are unsure
                how to write a paragraph element, see the following link:
                <a href="../../../resources/htmlsubset.htm#Paragraph">Paragaph Element</a>.  That link
                is part of the <a href="../../../resources/htmlsubset.htm">HTML Subset</a>, a handy page
                which attempts to summarize all the information you need to know for how to write HTML for this class.
            </p>
            <div class="answerFrame">
                <div class="answerButton">Move your mouse here to see what your file should look like
                after you have added the paragraph with Hello.</div>

            </div>
            <p>
                Save your file in the folder you created for the exercise.  Call it <b>default.html</b>.
            </p>
            <p>
                Open the folder and double-click on the file you created, and Chrome should open.  If Chrome
                is not your default web browser, then you may need to drag the file to the Chrome icon.
            </p>
            <p>
                You should see the following.
            </p>
            <img src="chrome1.png">
            <p>Congratulations, you created a web page!  <span class="woot"></span></p>
            <p>
                Notice that chrome is using the <b>file</b> protocol instead of <b>http</b>,
                because it is loading the files from a folder, instead of communicating over
                the internet.
            </p>
            <img src="chrome17.png">
            <h2>Conventions</h2>
            <p>
                To keep our work readable by others (including your teachers), we are going to adopt
                a set of <a href="../../../resources/htmlsubset.htm#Conventions">Conventions</a> when
                writing HTML.  You may want to take a look at them now.
            </p>
            <p class="sidenote">
                Many software developers have some set of conventions
                that they follow that are more restrictive than the grammar of the language.
                Consistency is important when working in teams. 
            </p>
            <p>
                After reading the conventions, you might notice that the template that Komodo Edit
                provided is not following our conventions (for example, the indenting is not right).  Lets fix that now.
                It is easier than you think, because Komodo Edit allows you to select a set of lines
                and then either "indent" them (shift them right) or "unindent" them (shift them left).
                You can find this command on the Code menu (or just use <b>Tab</b> and <b>Shift-Tab</b>
                keys).  This is a great command to learn.
            </p>
            <div class="answerFrame">
                <div class="answerButton">Move your mouse here to see the version of the file that follows our conventions.</div>
                <div class="answer">
                    <img src="komodo3.png">
                </div>
            </div>
            <p>
                Notice the vertical lines that Komodo Edit displays at each indentation level, which can help you
                understand where the indentation points in the file are.
            </p>
            <h2>How do I update my page?</h2>
            <p>
                Now change the text from <b>Hello</b> to <b>Jello</b>.
            </p>
            <p>
                Switch to Chrome and look at your page.  It still says Hello.  
            </p>
            <p>
                I bet you are thinking you just need to refresh the page to see it change from
                Hello to Jello.  Press the refresh button.
            </p>
            <img src="chrome2.png">
            <p>
                You still see Hello.  Why is this?
            </p>
            <div class="answerFrame">
                <div class="answerButton">Move your mouse here to see why.</div>
                <div class="answer">
                    <p>When you refresh your browser, it reloads the page from what is saved in your folder.
                    Since you did not save your page, it loaded the old page again.</p>
                </div>
            </div>
            <p>
                Save your page in Komodo Edit.  Go to Chrome and refresh.  Now it says Jello.  <span class="woot"></span>
            </p>
            <p>
                Go back to Komodo Edit and undo your change, which will bring
                back Hello.
            </p>
            <p class="sidenote">
                Undo is a programmers best friend.
                Notice that undo worked even though we saved the file.                
            </p>            
            <h2>What if I make a mistake?</h2>
            <p>
                We talked about the fact that HTML is a language, and it has a grammar.  What happens when we don't follow this grammar?
                Lets see.  Delete the &gt; as highlighted below, save, and refresh in Chrome. 
            </p>
            <img src="komodo4.png">
            <p>
                You should see a blank page.  When Chrome got to this part it was confused.
            </p>
            <div class="code">
                &lt;pHello&lt/p&gt;
            </div>
            <p>
                Go back to Komodo Edit and undo your change.
            </p>
            <h2 id="LessThan">How do I write a less than character?</h2>
            <p>
                Say we wanted to write a mathematical expression like the following in HTML.  How would we do it?
            </p>
            <p>
                <span class="code">0 &lt; a &lt; 10</span> 
            </p>
            <p>
                HTML is already using the less than symbol (&lt;) to indicate the start of a tag.  So how do we say
                we want the &lt; to just be treated as text instead of a tag?
            </p>
            <p>
                It turns out that HTML has a way to do this.  When we want
                to use a character that is already being used by the language, the language can give a different
                way of writing it.  
            </p>
            <p>
                Take a look at the <a href="../../../resources/htmlsubset.htm#CharacterReference">Character References</a>
                in our HTML Subset. Use the syntax provided there to display the mathematical expression
                above instead of Jello.  Save and reload in Chrome to make sure it matches the mathematical expression
                above.
            </p>
            <div class="answerFrame">
                <div class="answerButton">If you get stuck, move your mouse here to see the answer.</div>
                <div class="answer">
                    <p>                       
                    <span class="code">0 &amp;lt; a &amp;lt; 10</span>
                    </p>
                </div>
            </div>           
            <h2>Adding an image to the page</h2>
            <p>
                Command-click (Mac) or Right-click (Windows) on the smiley below to get the menu
                for the image.
                Choose "save image as" and save the image to your exercise folder as <b>smiley.png</b>.
            </p>
            <img src="smiley.png">
            <p class="sidenote">
                Be careful using images that you found on the web, since their use may be restricted.  
            </p>
            <p>
                An <a href="../../../resources/htmlsubset.htm#Image">Image Element</a>
                (abbreviated <b>img</b>) will display an image on a page.  But which image?
            </p>
            <p>
                The Image Element has an <b>Source Attribute</b> which controls
                which image to display.  
                In this case, we can just use the name of the image file
                (<b>smiley.png</b>) as the <b>value</b> for the attribute.  Our image
                element is then:
            </p>
            <div class="code">                       
                &lt;img src="smiley.png"&gt;
            </div>
            <p class="sidenote">
                Notice the Image Element has <b>start tag</b> (&lt;img&gt;), but no <b>end tag</b> (&lt;/img&gt;).
                This is because an Image Element is not a container for other elements or text.
            </p>
                
            <p>
                Add the Image Element so that it appears
                <b>after</b> your mathematical formula.
            </p>
            <p>
                You should see this:
            </p>
            <img src="chrome23.png">

            <h2>Adding an image between text</h2>
            <p>
                Add a image so that it replaces the variable <b>a</b> in our mathematical expression.
                You should see the following:
            </p>
            <img src="chrome5.png">
            <h2>Developer Tools</h2>
            <p>
                Although most people just use a web browser like Chrome to surf the web, there is a secret
                (OK, it's not that <a href="https://developers.google.com/chrome-developer-tools/">secret</a>) set of commands for people just like us that are trying
                to develop a web site.  That set of commands is typically called <b>Developer Tools</b>, and is
                available on many web browsers. 
            </p>
            <p>
                To bring up Developer Tools for a page loaded in Chrome, choose Tools / Developer Tools
                from the Chrome menu.  Your window should split in half vertically, and you should see
                something like the following:
            </p>
            <img src="chrome6.png">
            <h2>The Elements Tab</h2>
            <p>
                Notice the <b>Elements</b> tab is selected.  This tab shows you what text and elements are contained
                within what other elements.  Find the two images that you added to your page.  Note that
                you may need to expand the paragraph element.
            </p>
            <img src="chrome7.png">
            <p>
                You may have noticed that when you move your mouse over contents of the <b>Elements</b>
                tab, the elements on the page highlight.
            </p>            
            <p>
                Try clicking the magnifying glass icon at the bottom of the Chrome window (shown in yellow below):
            </p>
            <img src="chrome8.png">
            <p>
                Now move your mouse to the web page.  Try clicking on something within the page and notice
                that it selects the element within the <b>Elements</b> tab.
            </p>
            <p class="sidenote">
                The Elements tab is a great tool for understanding the elements that make up your HTML page.
                It lets you figure out what elements and text are contained within what other elements.
                It is also very useful for finding out where a particular element is positioned on the screen.
            </p>
            <h2>The Resources Tab</h2>
            <p>
                Remember when we talked about how a web browser loads a web page?  Remember the
                word <b>resource</b>?  What are the resources for this page?

                The Network tab should now have a table with two rows in it.
                Each row in the table is a resource that the browser has loaded.
                The first one is <b>default.html</b> resource, which contains the HTML.
                After the browser has examined the HTML and has found the Image Elements, it
                loads <b>smiley.png</b>, resulting in another row.
            </p>
            <h2>A missing resource</h2>
            <p>
                Go back to Komodo Edit and change the value of the <b>src</b> attribute of the
                first image from "smiley.png" to "grumpy.png".  Save, and go back to Chrome.
                Refresh the page in Chrome.  
            </p>
            <p>
                You will notice the first image has been replaced with a smaller image that
                Chrome uses when it can't find an image.
            </p>
            <img src="chrome12.png">
            <p>
                Take a look at the Network tab now.
            </p>
            <img src="chrome11.png">
            <p>
                Notice that the second row is red now, because there is an error.  Chrome can not find
                a resource named "grumpy.png" (there is no such file in your folder).
            </p>
            <p class="sidenote">The <b>Network</b> tab is useful for making sure all your resources are loading correctly.</p>
            <h2>The page title</h2>
            <p>
                Lets continue building our web site.
            </p>
            <p>
                Take a look at the <a href="../../../resources/htmlsubset.htm#Title">Title Element</a>
                section in our HTML Subset.
            </p>
            <p>
                Switch to Komodo Edit and change the title of your page to be <b>Math and Smileys</b>.
            </p>
            <p>
                Save and refresh the page in Chrome.  The new title should be displayed on the tab for the web page.
            </p>
            <img src="chrome13.png">
            <h2>A second page</h2>
            <p>
                Most web sites consist of more than one page.  Lets add a second page.
            </p>
            <p>
                Create a new HTML file using File / New on Komodo Edit.  Notice that since
                you have used the HTML5 template before, it now will show up directly within
                the File / New menu as a recently used template.
            </p>
            <p>
                Select the template, and a new tab will appear in Komodo Edit.                
            </p>
            <p>
                Fix up the formatting of the file so that it follows the 
                <a href="../../../resources/htmlsubset.htm#Conventions">Conventions</a> for this class.
                When you are done, you should have the following:
            </p>
            <img src="komodo6.png">
            <h2>Create an HTML template</h2>
            <p>
                Wait, am I going to do this reformating each time I want to create a new page?                
            </p>
            <p>
                Komodo Edit has a way to create your own <b>template</b>.  Since you just reformatted
                the HTML in the current tab, why don't we save that HTML as a template so we don't have
                to do the reformatting again.
            </p>
            <p>
                
                Use File / Save As Other / Template
                and call it <b>UPrep HTML.html</b>.                
            </p>
            <p>
                Since you changes have now been saved as a template, we can close the tab.
                Komodo Edit will ask if you want to save the changes for the tab.
                Select <b>No</b>.
            </p>
            <h2>Use your new template</h2>
            <p>
                Now go to File / New / From Template, and select <b>My Templates</b>.                
            </p>
            <img src="chrome24.png">
            <p>
                Choose your template (<b>UPrepHtml</b>) from the list of templates and
                select <b>Open</b>.
            </p>
            <p>
                A tab should open with the contents of your template.  You can now start building your second page.
            </p>
            <p>
                Change the title of the page to <b>Second Page</b>.  Add a paragraph with the words <b>Second Page</b>
                to the page.
            </p>
            <p>
                Save this file in your exercise folder.  Name it <b>page2.html</b>.
            </p>
            <h2>A hyperlink</h2>
            <p>
                Now lets create a hyperlink from the first page to the second page.
            </p>
            <p>
                Switch to the tab for the first page (<b>default.html</b>).  
            </p>
            <p>
                Take a look at the <a href="../../../resources/htmlsubset.htm#Anchor">Anchor Element</a>
                section in our HTML Subset, which describes how to create a hyperlink.  Use the
                <b>second</b> option listed there (<b>link to file</b>).
            </p>
            <p>
                Add an Anchor Element at the end of this page that links to the second page (<b>page2.html</b>).
                Put the text <b>Page 2</b> inside the Anchor Element.
            </p>
            <p>
                Save, switch to Chrome and refresh.  Your page should now have a link.
            </p>
            <img src="chrome14.png">
            <p>
                When you click on the link, Chrome will navigate to the second page.  <span class="woot"></span>
            </p>
            <img src="chrome16.png">
            <p>
                Press the Chrome back button to go back to the first page.
            </p>
            <h2>An image hyperlink</h2>
            <p>
                When you clicked on the <b>Page 2</b> text, Chrome automatically
                took you to the second page.  But when you click elsewhere on the page, it
                does not.  How does it know what part of the page is part of the hyperlink,
                and what parts are not?
            </p>
            <div class="answerFrame">
                <div class="answerButton">Move your mouse here to see the answer.</div>
                <div class="answer">
                    <p>
                        Chrome will navigate if you click on any text or elements
                        that are <b>contained within</b> the Anchor Element.
                    </p>
                </div>
            </div>
            <p>
                So what happens if we put an Image Element inside an Anchor Element?  Lets try and see.
            </p>
            <p>
                Create a second Anchor Element at the end of the first page (<b>default.html</b>).
                Put another smiley Image Element inside the Anchor Element.  You can use <b>Copy and Paste</b>
                to reuse existing elements instead of having to retype them.
            </p>
            <p class="sidenote">
                Copy and paste is a great tool for programmers to avoid having to retype something
                they want to use again. But be very careful that after you have pasted something, that you change everything
                that needs to be changed for the new usage. Also, when copying from the web, make sure you have
                the rights to use the thing you are copying.
            </p>
            <p>
                Save, and refresh Chrome.  You should see the following. 
            </p>
            <img src="chrome15.png">
            <p>
                Try clicking on the third smiley on the page.  Chrome should navigate to the second page. <span class="woot"></span>
            </p>
            <h2>A link to UPrep</h2>
            <p>
                So far we have been creating links to other pages in our own site.
                If we want to create a link to another site, we need to use the URL
                of the resource we want to link to.
            </p>
            <p>
                Take a look at the <a href="../../../resources/htmlsubset.htm#Anchor">Anchor Element</a>
                section in our HTML Subset, which describes how to create a hyperlink to a URL
                (see the <b>third</b> option, <b>Link to URL</b>).
            </p>
            <p>
                Add an Anchor Element 
                containing the text <b>University Prep</b> that links to the
                URL <b>http://www.universityprep.org</b>.

            <p>Save and refresh in Chrome.  You should see the following:</p>

            <p>
                Click on the Unversity Prep link, and it should take you to

            <h2>A link to an image</h2>
            <p>
                So far we have been creating links to other pages.  But images are resources
                just like pages are.  So we should be able to link to an image as well.
            </p>
            <p>
                Add an Anchor Element containing the text <b>Smiley</b> that links to the file
                <b>smiley.png</b>.  
            </p>
            <p>Save and refresh in Chrome.  You should see the following.</p>
            <img src="chrome19.png">
            <p>Click the Smiley link.  Chrome should navigate to the image, and will display it.</p>
            <img src="chrome20.png">
            <p>Web browsers know how to display all sorts of different kinds of resources,
