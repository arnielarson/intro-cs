            <h3>Do your pages have animations?</h3>
            <p>
                In this exercise, we are going to be drawing on the canvas
                at a regular interval to make an animation.
            </p>
            <h3>How does animation work?</h3>
            <p>
                <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eadweard_Muybridge">Eadweard Muybridge</a>
                is credited with pioneering work in motion picture projection.  You may
                be familiar with the "horse in motion", which showed that all four feet
                leave the ground at a gallop.

            <p>
                As you can see above, a galloping horse animation is simply a series
                of pictures (called <b>frames</b>) played fast enough to convince
                your brain that something is moving.
            </p>
            <p>
                How fast do we need to play the frames in order for it to look right?
                It <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frame_rate">varies</a>.
                Movies are typically around <b>24 frames per second</b>, but video games are
                typically higher.
            </p>
            <h3>When do we draw?</h3>
            <p>
                So lets say we want to animate at 2 frames a second.  This means we need to draw,
                and then wait for a while, and then draw again, and so on.
            </p>
            <img src="diagram1.png">
            <h3>Drawing on a regular basis</h3>
            <p>
                To draw each frame, we need to call some function that we have written.  So we really need a way to
                call a function when a certain amount of time has gone by.  
            </p>
            <p>
                Javascript has a function
                that lets us do that, called <b>setInterval</b>.  
            </p>
            <div class="signature">
            setInterval(<div class="parameter">function</div>, <div class="parameter">milliseconds</div>)
            </div>
            <p>
                To use this function, we need to give a function that we want to call
                (which will draw a frame),
                and we need to give how often we want it called in milliseconds.
            </p>
            <p class="idea">
                A <b>millisecond</b> is 1/1000th of a second, and is abbreviated <b>ms</b>.
                
            </p>
            <p>
                For example, the following calls <b>setInterval</b>
                when the page loads so that the function <b>drawFrame</b>
                will be called twice a second (2 frames per second, or every 500ms which is 1/2 second).
            </p>
            <div class="code">
function drawSomething(context) {<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="annotation">draw something here</span><br>
}<br>
<br>
function drawFrame() {<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;var canvas = document.getElementById("mainCanvas");<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;var context = canvas.getContext("2d");<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;drawSomething(context);&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
}<br>
<br>
function start() {<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;var framesPerSecond = 2;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;setInterval(drawFrame, 1000 / framesPerSecond);<br>
}<br>
            </div>
            <div class="instruction">
            <p>
                Download the <a href="Exercise%201.5.2.zip">zip</a>
                and change the <b>drawSomething</b> function
                to draw a <a href="../../../resources/canvassubset.htm#FillCircle">Circle</a>.
            </p>                
            </div>
            <p>
                Try it out.  You should see a circle on your page.
            </p>                
            <h3>It is just sitting there...</h3>
            <p>
                At this point, we are drawing 2 frames a second, but the
                frames are exactly the same each time.  We need to change
                something, otherwise our animation will never change (which
                is a pretty boring animation).
            </p>
            <p>
                If we change the <b>x</b> position of the circle each frame
                (by adding 1 to it), then
                the circle should move across the screen (from left to right). 
            </p>
            <img src="diagram2.png">
            <p>
                This means we need to keep track of where the circle is,
                which means we need a variable.  We need to use a <b>global</b>
                variable, since the value is not just used within one function.
            </p>
            <div class="instruction">
            <p>
                Go ahead and make the changes <span class="highlight">shown below</span>.
            </p>
                
            </div>
            <p>
                We have added a global
                variable <b>x</b>, and a function <b>changeSomething</b>
                that changes it, and we are calling <b>changeSomething</b>
                each time we draw a frame.  This means the value of the
                variable x will increase each frame.                
            </p>
            <div class="code">
<span class="highlight">var x = 0;</span><br>
<br>
function drawSomething(context) {<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
}<br>
<br>
<span class="highlight">function changeSomething() {<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;x = x + 1;<br>
}<br></span>
<br>
function drawFrame() {<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;var canvas = document.getElementById("mainCanvas");<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;var context = canvas.getContext("2d");<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="highlight">changeSomething();</span><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;drawSomething(context);<br>
}<br>
<br>
function start() {<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;var framesPerSecond = 2;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;setInterval(drawFrame, 1000 / framesPerSecond);<br>
}<br>                
            </div>
            <p>
                Even though the variable is increasing every frame, it does not
                mean we are drawing anything different.
            </p>
            <div class="instruction">
                <p>
                Change <b>drawSomething</b>
                to use the value of <b>x</b> when drawing the circle.
                </p>                
            </div>
            <p>
                Try it out.  
            </p>
            <h3>It is smearing!</h3>
            <p>
                You should see a circle slowly smearing from
                left to right and then disappear off the right edge
                of the canvas.
            </p>
            <img src="chrome1.png">
            <p>
                Each time you draw on a canvas, it just adds more
                "paint".  We want to start with a clean canvas
                each time we draw a frame in order to make this
                look like an animation.
            </p>
            <div class="instruction">
                <p>
                    Before you paint your circle,
                    <a href="../../../resources/canvassubset.htm#FillCanvas">fill the canvas</a>
                    with another color.
                </p>                
            </div>
            <p>
                You should now see a circle moving slowly across the screen.
            </p>

                    Try increasing the number of frames per second and see
                    what happens.
