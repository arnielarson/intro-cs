            <h1>Exercise 1.5.5</h1>
            <h2>Canvas</h2>
            <h3>Another dimension</h3>
            <p>
                Up until this point, our circle has been moving from left to right
                (horizontally) and bouncing.
                Let's make it move vertically as well (and bounce).  
            </p>
            <p>
                In english, we want to do the following for every frame:
            </p>
            <p class="idea">
                Add <b>dx</b> to the value of <b>x</b>.<br>
                If <b>x</b> has reached the <b>right</b> edge of the canvas then negate the value of <b>dx</b>.<br>
                If <b>x</b> has reached the <b>left</b> edge of the canvas then negate the value of <b>dx</b>.<br>
                What else?  We need to something similar for the vertical
                direction.  This is for you to figure out.
            </p>
            <div class="instruction">
                <p>
                    Starting with the files from the last exercise,
                    create a folder for this exercise (<b>Exercise 1.5.5</b>).
                    Make changes so that the circle moves vertically and
                    horizontally, and bounces when it reaches the edge of the canvas.
                    The top of the canvas is <b>0</b>.  The bottom of the canvas
                    is <b>canvas.height</b>.
                </p>
            </div>
            <p class="sidenote">
                If your circle is taking a too-predicable path, use a vertical change
                of 3, and a horizontal change of 7.
            </p>
            <h2>Done!</h2>
            <p>
                Head back to Schoology and submit your files.
