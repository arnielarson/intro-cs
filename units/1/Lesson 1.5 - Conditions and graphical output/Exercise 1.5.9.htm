            <h1>Exercise 1.5.9</h1>
            <h2>Canvas</h2>
            <h3>Up to you now</h3>
            <p>
                Now it's your turn.  Make a new creation,
                or change the one you have been working on.
                It's up to you.
            </p>
            <p>
                For example, you could:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Add a second circle</li>
                <li>Make the circles bounce when they run into each other</li>
                <li>Add gravity</li>
                <li>Add some randomness to the movement of the circle (using <span class="code">Math.random())</span></li>
            </ul>            
            <h2>Done!</h2>
            <p>
