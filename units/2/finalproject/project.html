            <h1>Individual Project</h1>

            <p>
                We will be spending the remainder of the semester working on an individual 
                project.  This project is designed to give you an experience
                building a larger program.
            </p>

            <h2>Overview</h2>

            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        You can choose from one of the projects listed <a
                        href="#Choices">below</a>.
                        The projects are ordered from least difficult (first) to most difficult (last).
                        However, the difficulty of all projects can be increased
                        by having a more elaborate design.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>You are encouraged to work with other students, but the work you hand in must be your own.  You may 
                        use the <a href="../../../resources/bootstrap.htm">Bootstrap</a> CSS framework.</p>

                </li>

                <li>
                    <p>The project is due at <span class="red">the end of
                    the semester </span>. 
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>This project will count 20% towards the final grade.</p>
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Stages</h3>

            <p>
                There are several stages to this project:
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        Read all the instructions.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        Write a <a href="#Proposal">Proposal</a> and submit it before you start.
                        
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        Identify the steps that you will take to create your
                        project.  
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        Write and test the code.  Use <a href="../../../resources/guide.htm">The Guide</a>, which contains examples of the concepts we have learned in this class.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        Write a <a href="#Reflection">Reflection</a>.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        Submit ALL your program files and your Reflection.  You may need to 
                        create a ZIP to upload if you have many files.
                    </p>
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h2 id="Proposal">Proposal</h2>

            <p>
                Before you start programming, you should submit a proposal
                and get feedback 
                on what you plan to do for the project.  Your proposal should briefly describe <span class="red">what</span>
                your program is going to do to solve the particular problem you chose.
            </p>

            <h2 id="Reflection">Reflection</h2>

            <p>
                You should submit a reflection document at the same time you submit your final program.  Your  reflection
                should include answers to the following questions.  You can submit a Word document or a link
                to a Google document.
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        If you were to start over, what would you do differently?
                        How can your solution be improved?
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        Would this program be a good starting point to solve other problems?
                    </p>
                </li>
            </ol>

            <h2>Rubric</h2>

            <p>This project will be assessed based on how well it accomplishes the following:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        Your program solves the problem that was described.
                    </p>
                </li>                
                <li>
                    <p>
                        You have included a way for the user to control what the program 
                        does (input).
                        Your teachers can figure out how to operate your program
                        without asking you for help.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        You understand and can explain all the code you submitted.  Your 
                        teachers may ask you to explain the code you submitted.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        You chose the correct Javascript concept for each part of your program.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        Your algorithms are easy to understand because you have broken down
                        the problem into sub problems and have created functions for each
                        sub problem.  You wrote functions that can be used by different
                        parts of the code instead of duplicating 
                        the same code.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        You have used the appropriate data structures for each part
                        of your program.  For example, you used arrays for lists of things, objects for related things, etc.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        Your program is easy to read because you have included <a href="../../../resources/jssubset.htm#Comment">Comments</a> and have chosen good
                        <a href="../../../resources/jssubset.htm#Name">Names</a>.
                        Some of the projects include a ZIP download which contain Javascript
                        data.  You are not responsible for the naming used in these files.                    
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        Your program appears to function correctly.
                        Your program is error free in Chrome <span class="red">after</span>
                        your teachers have tried to use it.  This means you need to test
                        the different cases.  You may want to have another student
                        try your program before handing it in.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        You submitted a complete reflection.

                        Biogeography, the study of the geography of life, has a long and distinguished history, and one interwoven with that of ecology and evolutionary biology.  Traditionally viewed as the study of geographic distributions, modern biogeography now explores a great diversity of patterns in the geographic variation of nature — from physiological, morphological and genetic variation among individuals and populations to differences in the diversity and composition of biotas along geographic gradients.  Given its interdisciplinary and integrative nature, biogeography is now broadly recognized as a unifying field that provides a holistic understanding of the relationships between the earth and its biota. Our abilities to develop more general theories of the diversity of life, and to conserve biological diversity may well rest on insights from the field of biogeography.

                        Astronomy at the beginning of the 21st century, and particularly research arising from wide-field survey observatories at various wavebands, finds itself with serious challenges in statistical treatments of data to achieve its astrophysical goals. A vast range of statistical problems arise in the scientific interpretation of astronomical studies involving sampling, multivariate and survival analysis, image and spatial analysis, signal processing and time series analysis, nonlinear regression, and more.
