MODELING DATA

two types of values:
- scalars: numbers, text, booleans, null
- structures: objects (related values), arrays (repeating values)
- we can combine these arbitrarily

modeling data
- given a problem, what data structure should I use?
- what do I want to represent (not everything)?
- how should I represent it?

practice (problems)
- 

PROBLEM SOLVING
- simplified version of "how to program it"

life algorithm
- http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life
- 2d or 1d array?
- different seeds
- requires array
- requires animation
- have all the grids as data

bar chart
- plot the number of students in a school object
- make an array with the values in it
- generalize this to take an array of values
- need to scale the values (min, max)

RUNNING TIME

Number of items.  O(1)
Sum of items. O(n)
Selection sort.  O(n^2)
Binary search O(log n)
Merge sort.  O(n log n)

Generate an array with n random numbers.

Test with 1,100,1000,10000,100000,1000000.

Test function: will generate array for N, and call other function with array, and return time.  We can get time from debugger, and chart N vs. Time.

What do we see?  Different curves: quadratic, logarithmic, linear, constant.

Introduction to asymptotic notation, and classes of algorithm running times.

Notice that we all got the same result, even though our computers were different speeds.

Why running time is important.  Explanation of what is computable by different running times.


SORTING

sorting an array
- bubble sort 
- light ones float to the top
- repeat with smaller length list
- http://cs50.tv/2012/fall/shorts/bubble_sort/bubble_sort-720p.mp4
- mentions asymptotic notation

comparer
- generalizes the notion of comparison

insertion sort
- http://cs50.tv/2012/fall/shorts/insertion_sort/insertion_sort-720p.mp4
- does insertion at the end by shifting to the right until correct position found

selection sort
- http://cs50.tv/2012/fall/shorts/selection_sort/selection_sort-720p.mp4
- pick the one that is smallest, of the remaining

merge sort
- nlogn
- requires additional storage

javascript methods
- quicksort
- sort method on array

SEARCHING

linear search
- http://cs50.tv/2012/fall/shorts/linear_search/linear_search-720p.mp4

binary search
- first part: binary search in array
- http://cs50.tv/2012/fall/shorts/binary_search/binary_search-720p.mp4

ADDITIONAL DATA STRUCTURES

stack
- use insert/delete to implement a stack
- concept of fifo, real world equivalents

queue
- use insert/delete to implement a queue
- concept of lifo, real world equivalents

hash tables
- the concept of hashing
- TODO: has to be a simple example for this

trees
- binary search tree?

graphs
- facebook friends
