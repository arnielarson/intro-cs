            <h1>Exercise 2.6.2</h1>
            <h2>Angry Input</h2>
            <h3>This may be familar</h3>
            <p>
                In this exercise, we'll be working with the following
                example.
            </p>
            <div class="instruction">
                <p>
                    Download the following <a href="inputs2.6.2.zip">zip</a>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Try it out.  What does it do?
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="space"></div>
            <h3>It doesn't do much...</h3>
            <p>
                Lets finish this example.   We will be making the following changes:
            </p>
            <div class="instruction">
                <p>Handle launching of a bird using the mouse.</p>
                <p>Handle the click on the "Start Over" button.</p>
                <p>Handle the click on the "Launch Bird" button.</p>
            </div>
            <p class="idea">
                Add your code to <b>uprep.js</b>.
            </p>
            <p class="idea">
                Use the code you downloaded in the <a href="inputs1.html">last exercise</a>
                as an example for how to handle various events (<b>look in events.js</b>).
            </p>
            <h3>Launching a bird using the mouse</h3>
            <p>
                In order to launch the bird with the mouse/trackpad, we need to handle THREE events:                
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    <p>When mouse button is pressed down (<b>onmousedown</b> event) on the canvas (id is "mainCanvas"), do this:</p>
                    <div class="code">
                        putBirdInRubberBand(x, y);
                    </div>
                    <p>
                        This will put a new bird into the rubber band.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        You will need to get the x and y from the event object.
                    </p>
                    <div class="check">
                        <p>
                            When you click in the canvas, as bird should be added to the
                            rubber band where you click, BUT... when you drag or let go, NOTHING
                            will happen.
                        </p>
                    </div>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>When mouse is moved (<b>onmousemove</b> event) over the canvas (id is "mainCanvas"), do this:</p>
                    <div class="code">
                        moveRubberBand(x, y);
                    </div>
                    <p>
                        This will redraw the rubber band as you move the mouse.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        You will need to get the x and y from the event object.
                    </p>
                    <div class="check">
                        <p>
                            You can now click and drag and the rubber band should follow your movement, BUT...
                            when you let up NOTHING will happen.
                        </p>
                    </div>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>When mouse button is released (<b>onmouseup</b> event) over the canvas (id is "mainCanvas"), do this:</p>
                    <div class="code">
                        releaseRubberBand();
                    </div>
                    <p>
                        This will actually launch the bird, and will make space for a new one.
                    </p>
                    <div class="check">
                        <p>
                            You should now be able to launch birds with your mouse.  <span class="woot"></span>
                        </p>
                    </div>
                </li>
            </ol>
            <h3>The "Start Over" button</h3>
            <p>
                To make the "Start Over" button work, we need to handle one event:               
            </p>
            <p>
                When the mouse button is pressed and released (<b>onclick</b> event) on the "Start Over" button (id is "start"), do this:
            </p>
            <div class="code">
                startGame();
            </div>
            <p>
                This is used to start or restart the game.
            </p>
            <div class="check">
                <p>
                    When you press the "Start Over" button, a new set of pigs should appear.
                </p>
            </div>
            <h3>The "Launch Bird" button</h3>
            <p>
                To make the "Launch Bird" button work, we need to handle one event:
            </p>
            <p>
                When the mouse button is pressed and released (<b>onclick</b> event) on the "Launch Bird" button (id is "launch"), do this:
            </p>
            <div class="code">
                launchBirdAtAngleAndSpeed(angle, speed);
            </div>
            <p>
                This will load a bird and launch it, given a speed and an the angle (in degrees).
            </p>
            <p>
                You will need to get the angle and speed values from the text elements.
                The id's of the elements are "angle" and "speed".
            </p>
            <div class="check">
                <p>
                    When you press the "Launch Bird" button, a bird should launch with
                    correct angle and speed.
                </p>
            </div>
            
            <h2>Done!</h2>
