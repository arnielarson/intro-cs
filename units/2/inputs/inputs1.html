            <h1>Exercise 2.6.1</h1>
            <h2>Input</h2>
            <h3>The human touch</h3>
            <p>
                In this lesson, we will learn how to have our programs react
                to a person using a web page.
                We will be working with the following types of <b>input</b>:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Mouse/trackpad clicking and movement</li>
                <li>Keyboard input</li>
                <li>Resizing of the browser window</li>
                <li>Touch input (if you have a touch device)</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Try it out</h3>
            <p>
                Lets try out an example to see how it works.
            </p>
            <div class="instruction">
                <p>
                    Download the following <a href="inputs2.6.1.zip">zip</a>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Click, drag and type.  See what happens.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Try touching if you have a touch device.
                </p>
            </div>
            <h3>Events</h3>
            <p>
                When person uses the mouse, trackpad, touches,
                or types a key, <b>events</b> are recorded for different
                elements of the page.  
            </p>
            <p>
                When these events happen,
                we can have Chrome <b>call a function we write</b>.
                This is called <b>handling</b> an event.
            </p>
            <p>
                This example handles different events and displays
                information about them on the canvas (large
                rectangle) when the events happen.
            </p>
            <img src="chrome1.png">
            <p class="idea">
                Events happen for a particular element of the page.
            </p>
            <h3>Mouse/trackpad events</h3>
            <p>
                The following events happen when a person uses a mouse:
            </p>
            <table class="simple">
                <tr>
                    <th>Event</th>
                    <th>Meaning</th>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>onmousedown</td>
                    <td>When a mouse button is <b>pressed down</b> while the mouse is in the element</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>onmousemove</td>
                    <td>When a mouse pointer is <b>moved</b> while in the element</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>onmouseup</td>
                    <td>When a mouse button is <b>released</b> while the mouse is in the element</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>onclick</td>
                    <td>
                        When a mouse button is <b>pressed down</b> and <b>released</b>
                        while the mouse is in the element
                    </td>
                </tr>
            </table>
            
            <div class="instruction">
                <p>Try using the mouse in the canvas area of the example and watch the events.</p>
            </div>
            
            <h3>Key events</h3>
            <p>                
                Keyboard input is sent to the element that has <b>focus</b>,
                which is "where am I typing".   A focused
                element is usually drawn differently, for example:
            </p>
            <img src="chrome2.png">
            <p>
                The following events happen when someone uses the keyboard:
            </p>
            <table class="simple">
                <tr>
                    <th>Event</th>
                    <th>Meaning</th>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>onkeydown</td>
                    <td>When a key is <b>pressed</b> or repeats</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>onkeyup</td>
                    <td>When a key is <b>released</b></td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>onkeypress</td>
                    <td>When a key is <b>pressed</b> (or repeats) and the character is a regular <b>printable</b> character</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>onchange</td>
                    <td>
                        After the text in an a text element has <b>been changed</b> and it no longer has the focus.
                    </td>
                </tr>
            </table>
            
            <div class="instruction">
                <p>Try typing in the name and weight text areas watch the events.</p>
            </div>
                        
            
            <h3>Resize events</h3>
            <p>
                When the user resizes the browser window, there is a resize event.
                This event happens for the <b>window</b> object.
            </p>
            <table class="simple">
                <tr>
                    <th>Event</th>
                    <th>Meaning</th>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>onresize</td>
                    <td>When the browser is being resized by the user.</td>
                </tr>                
            </table>
            
            <div class="instruction">
                <p>Try resizing the window and watch the events.</p>
            </div>
            
            <h3>How to handle events</h3>            
            <p>
                In order to
                handle an event,
                you need to know:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Which element?</li>
                <li>Which event?</li>
            </ul>            
            <p>
                The steps to handle an event are very similar for all events, and are shown below.  Note that
                the placeholders (like <span class="placeholder">someVariable</span>)
                need to be filled in by you.
            </p>
            <div class="code">
                function start() {<br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;var <span class="placeholder">someVariable</span> = document.getElementById("<span class="placeholder">someId</span>");<br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="placeholder">someVariable</span>.<span class="placeholder">someEvent</span> = <span class="placeholder">someFunction</span>;<br>
                }
            </div>
            <p>
                You need to write a function for each event you want to handle.  This
                function has a single parameter, an <b>event object</b>, which contains
                additional information about what happened.
            </p>
            <div class="code">
                function <span class="placeholder">someFunction</span>(event) {<br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="annotation">do something here!</span><br>
                }                
            </div>
            <h3>Take a closer look</h3>
            <div class="instruction">
                <p>
                    Open <b>event.js</b>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Look at how the <b>onmousedown</b> event is
                    handled for the canvas element
                    set up in the <b>start</b> function.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Look at <b>canvasMouseDown</b> for how the the function
                    can access information about an event (like the x and y
                    location).
                </p>
                <p>
                    You will be using these techniques in the next exercise.
                    Keep this example around, because you will be refering to it.
                </p>
            </div>
                
            <h2>Done!</h2>
            <p>
                Head back to Schoology and mark this as done.
